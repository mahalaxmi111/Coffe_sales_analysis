# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard

## About this project
This dashboard presents insights to the regional manager of a coffee chain with 3 different stores. The goal is to optimize the operations based on the data collected from these stores.

## What the project does
The dashboard highlights key metrics such as revenue growth, busiest days and hours, top-selling categories and products, and underperforming products.

## Why the project is useful
By analyzing the data, the dashboard helps identify trends and patterns which can be used to make informed decisions to improve store operations, increase sales, and reduce costs.

## Insights
- **Revenue**: Continuously growing.
- **Busiest Days**: Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays.
- **Busiest Hours**: Mornings.
- **Top Category**: Coffee.
- **Top Product**: Barista Espresso.

## Data Story
I have noticed that the bottom products for all the stores include some flavors and other products like coffee beans. Additionally, the merchandise clothing for Astoria is way less compared to other stores. Providing discount offers at this store might increase sales or it could be considered to remove such products from display and keep them available on order only to reduce operational costs.
